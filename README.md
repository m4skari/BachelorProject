# BachelorProject
A hybrid framework for portfolio optimization combining deep learning-based stock price prediction (CNN-BiLSTM) with Markowitz’s mean–variance model. Implements robust data preprocessing, time series forecasting, and optimal portfolio construction on S&amp;P 500 data to achieve higher Sharpe ratios and improved risk-adjusted returns.
